## EXPERIENCE

### Software Engineer

**A.P. Moller - Maersk** | April 2025 - Present, Bengaluru, India

- Delivered backend improvements across critical services, enhancing API reliability by 30% and reducing response times by 20% through targeted performance and error-handling optimisations.
- Led the design and delivery of the operational writeback feature used across multiple business units, recognised at an organisation-wide town hall.
- Designed and implemented a Spring Boot microservices architecture that reduced infrastructure costs by 40% and enabled zero-downtime deployments.
- Integrated automated testing into CI/CD (GitHub Actions), achieving 85% coverage in critical modules and reducing regression risk across releases.
- Applied polyglot engineering practices across Java, Kotlin, Python, and TypeScript services, driving modular design and reusable shared libraries.
- Mentored junior engineers and led code reviews, raising code quality standards and strengthening testing practices across the team.

### Associate Software Engineer

**A.P. Moller - Maersk** | August 2022 - March 2025, Bengaluru, India

## PROJECTS

### Ripplemark

[github.com/kushal-sharma-works/ripplemark](https://github.com/kushal-sharma-works/ripplemark)

- Built a distributed dependency-intelligence platform for microservice ecosystems that catalogs services, manages dependency graphs, and estimates change blast radius before release.
- Designed a polyglot multi-service architecture with NestJS (auth gateway, topology), FastAPI (impact analysis), Django + DRF (registry), and Angular (frontend), communicating via REST and NATS event messaging.
- Implemented real-time dependency graph visualization using D3.js and WebSockets (Socket.io), enabling live topology updates as services and dependencies change.
- Built a change-impact analysis engine in FastAPI that computes blast radius and risk scores by traversing service dependency graphs, with Redis-backed caching for performance.
- Designed a multi-database strategy using PostgreSQL for relational registry data, MongoDB for flexible graph document storage, and Redis for caching and session management.
- Configured CI/CD with GitHub Actions including automated testing (Jest, pytest), linting (ESLint, Ruff), security scanning (CodeQL), and Docker image publishing to GHCR.
- Packaged services for Kubernetes deployment using Helm charts with ArgoCD-driven GitOps for continuous delivery.

### Auctor Platform

[github.com/kushal-sharma-works/auctor-platform](https://github.com/kushal-sharma-works/auctor-platform) | January 2026 - Present

- Built a policy-driven workflow platform using Java 21, Kotlin, Next.js 14, gRPC, GraphQL, and Redis to handle definition authoring, policy evaluation, and execution end-to-end, eliminating external compliance tooling.
- Reduced cross-service call overhead via immutable versioned definitions and a Caffeine + Redis cache layer across 3 gRPC methods, keeping execution latency stable at scale.
- Enabled zero-downtime policy changes by splitting definition and execution into two independent services, allowing governance rules to ship without restarting the runtime.
